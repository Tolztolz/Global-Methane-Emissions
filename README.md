# Global Methane Emissions Analysis Dashboards

This GitHub repository showcases my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Power Query and Power BI to create interactive dashboards for analyzing global methane emissions. The dataset was gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions

## Introduction
As a data professional with a passion for environmental sustainability, I have developed a series of dynamic visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, to provide valuable insights into key aspects of methane emissions. These visualizations cover regions with the highest emissions, top countries contributing to emissions, top African countries with significant emissions, sub-sectors that contribute the most to emissions, sectors with the highest emissions, and reasons behind emissions. In addition, I have incorporated an interactive filter for year, allowing users to explore trends and patterns over time.

## Features
- Regions with Most Emissions: 
  Dynamic bar charts showcasing the geographical distribution of methane emissions, helping stakeholders prioritize regions for targeted emission reduction efforts
  
- Top Countries with Most Emissions: 
  Bar charts that highlight the proportion of emissions from different countries, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders to prioritize actions and policies to mitigate emissions.
  
- Top African Countries with Most Emissions: 
  Dynamic bar charts that showcase the emissions profiles of African countries, allowing users to identify the key contributors to methane emissions in the region and develop targeted strategies for reducing emissions in Africa.
  
- Sub-Sector Contribution to Most Emissions: 
  Interactive bar charts showcasing the contributions of different sub-sectors to methane emissions, helping users identify the major sources of emissions within specific sectors. Sub-sectors may include onshore oil, steam coal, onshore gas pipelines, bioenergy, and other relevant sub-sectors.
  
- Sector with Most Emissions: 
  Dynamic bar charts that highlight the proportion of emissions from different sectors, such as agriculture, energy, waste, and others, helping users understand which sectors are the major contributors to methane emissions globally and informing policy decisions and prioritization of actions.
  
- Reasons behind Emissions: 
  Dynamic pie charts showcasing the major sources of methane emissions, allowing users to identify the key drivers of emissions in different regions and sectors. The reasons for emissions include vented (methane released to the atmosphere intentionally), fugitive (methane emissions from unintended leaks or releases), and flared (methane burned off at oil and gas production sites).

## Interactive Year Filter
My dashboards also feature an interactive year filter that allows users to select specific years of interest and observe changes in methane emissions over time. This feature enables dynamic data exploration and analysis, helping users gain a comprehensive understanding of the temporal dynamics of methane emissions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Explore the different visualizations and use the interactive year filter to analyze methane emissions data.
4. Provide corrections and feedback by creating an issue in the repository. Your feedback is welcome and will help improve the quality and accuracy of the analysis.

## Corrections and Feedback
I welcome corrections and feedback to improve the accuracy and quality of the methane emissions analysis. Please create an issue in the repository to report any corrections or provide feedback. Your input is valuable and will be taken into consideration for future updates to the dashboards.

## Corrections and Feedback
If you have any questions or suggestions about the dashboard, please feel free to contact me at [omitolaabdulbasit@gmail.com](mailto:omitolaabdulbasit@gmail.com). I would be happy to hear from you and help in any way possible!.
